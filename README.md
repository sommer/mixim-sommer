# Veins - The open source vehicular network simulation framework.

Veins is an open source framework for running vehicular network simulations.
It is based on two well-established simulators: OMNeT++, an event-based network simulator, and SUMO, a road traffic simulator.
It extends these to offer a comprehensive suite of models for IVC simulation.

See the Veins <a href="http://veins.car2x.org/">website</a> for a tutorial documentation, and publications.

If you use Veins or one of its component models, we would appreciate a citation of our work:
